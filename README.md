# Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction using Random Forest

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether an existing customer is likely to purchase **health insurance** using machine learning techniques. The solution is built using a **Random Forest Classifier**, a robust ensemble algorithm well-suited for handling complex, non-linear relationships in structured insurance data.

The project is designed to reflect a **real-world insurance analytics use case**, supporting data-driven decision-making for marketing, underwriting, and customer targeting teams.

## Business Problem
Insurance companies often struggle to identify which existing customers are most likely to respond positively to cross-sell campaigns. Inefficient targeting leads to:
- Higher customer acquisition costs  
- Lower campaign conversion rates  
- Poor utilization of marketing resources  

This project addresses the problem by predicting **cross-sell propensity**, enabling insurers to focus efforts on high-probability customers.

## Objective
- Predict customer likelihood of purchasing health insurance  
- Improve cross-sell targeting efficiency  
- Reduce marketing costs and increase conversion rates  

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-level information typically available to insurance providers, including:
- Demographic details
- Vehicle information
- Policy history
- Customer response indicators

The target variable represents whether the customer opted for health insurance.

## Solution Approach
The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
3. Feature encoding and preparation  
4. Train-test data split  
5. Model training using Random Forest  
6. Model evaluation and performance analysis  
7. Interpretation of results  

## Algorithm Selection
**Random Forest Classifier** was selected due to:
- Ability to model non-linear relationships  
- Robustness to noise and outliers  
- Strong performance on tabular insurance data  
- Built-in feature importance for interpretability  

## Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using industry-standard classification metrics:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall (Sensitivity)  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

These metrics provide a balanced view of predictive performance, especially for business decision-making.
